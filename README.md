========

Pong based on the example from the Elm-lang website, with some additional features

Original blog post by *Evan Czaplicki*: http://elm-lang.org/blog/Pong.elm

Features to build:
- [X] Mid field line
- [X] Add the ability to pause the game during game play.

- [X] Add the ability to reset the game (besides refreshing the page!)

- [ ] Make ball collisions more complicated. Possiblities:
        When the ball hits the corner of a paddle, it changes direction.
        If the ball hits a moving paddle, it adds spin to the ball, making it rebound in a different direction.

- [ ] Add a second ball to the game.

- [X] Write a simple AI for a paddle. A simple strategy is to always put the paddle at the same y height as the ball, but this is not very fun to play against. Maybe try an AI that is not so smart to make things more interesting.
